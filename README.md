# C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms II - 07/16/2025

# Overview

We are given 3 trucks to deliver 40 packages by COB. Package delivery locations are
given in a provided CSV file, and must be delivered in under a certain amount of 
total mileage. A CLI user interface has also been created for users to track the
status of a package given a specific time, with the option to see the status
of all packages at that time. Upon exiting the UI, The mileage for each truck, as
well as the total combined mileage, is printed to the screen. The nearest neighbor 
algorithm was utilized in order to reduce the total mileage to an acceptable amount.
